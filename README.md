This chess game is the final project for Harvard's CS50, an introduction to computer science.

This project was meant to be an exercise in object-oriented programming (OOP).
OOP principles like polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance served as the backbone for this project.
Below is a brief demo of the game in action.
